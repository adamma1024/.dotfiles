### iTerm profile

Import the iTerm's profile from the `./iterm/ML Theme.json`
Also, I am using the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme, since I love the awesome concept of Dracula.

But, it seems that they'll provide the light theme soon, Lmao 😂

1. Add installing steps for Homebrow, iterms, zsh, neovim, nerd font, starship
